1. Element Selector
    Class
        - we can style with specific element.
        - we can use multiple times.
    ID
        - Id is more powerful than class. If we mention class
        along with ID. CSS will apply ID on higher priority.
         
        - ID is supposed to use only one time.
    
    Inline 
    
        - It's much more powerful than class & ID. It's overwrite 
          class and ID css. 

    Pseudo Selectors :

        - we can do animation and transition part
        - Ex (
                :hover,
                :firstChild,
                :lastChild,
                :nth-child,
                :onlychild- only-child CSS pseudo-class represents 
                            an element without any siblings
                :link
                :visited )
